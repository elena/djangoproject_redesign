=============================================
Redesign of http://www.djangoproject.com
=============================================

Locations of important files:

* ``docs/`` - project documentation (Sphinx)
* ``requirements`` - project dependencies
* ``static`` - Project's `static files <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/howto/static-files/#using-django-contrib-staticfiles>`_
* ``templates`` - Django templates for the redesign.

Note: this project has no models and its views simply render templates containing static content. This is to facilitate integration of new templates and static media into the existing djangoproject.org site.
