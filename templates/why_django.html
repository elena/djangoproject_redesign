<h1>Why Django?</h1>
    <!-- 5-8 marketing points about Django. These should be plain-english benefits. Even if they’re ostensibly developer benefits, they should be obvious benefits for PHBs. -->
    <p>
    <ul id="features">
        <li><strong>Ridiculously fast.</strong> Django was designed to help developers take web applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Fully loaded.</strong> Django includes dozens of extras that you can use to handle common web development patterns. Django takes care of user authentication, content administration, sitemaps, RSS, user comments, and many more tasks right out of the box.</li>
        <li><strong>Reassuringly secure.</strong>Django takes security seriously and helps web developers avoid many of the common security mistakes, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, clickjacking, and more. Its user authentication system provides a secure way to manage user accounts and passwords.</li>
        <li><strong>Exceedingly scalable.</strong> Some of the busiest websites leverage Django’s ability to quickly and flexibly scale to meet even the heaviest traffic demands.</li>
        <li><strong>Incredibly versatile.</strong> Companies, organizations, and governments have used Django to build all sorts of things—from content management systems to social networks to scientific computing platforms.</li>
    </ul>
