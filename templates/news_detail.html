<h1>Django 1.5 beta 1 released</h1>

<span class="meta">Posted by <a href="#" rel="author">James Bennett</a> on November 27, 2012 in <a href="#">Release Announcements</a></span>

<p>As part of the Django 1.5 release process, today we've released Django 1.5 beta 1, a preview/testing package that gives a little taste of some of the new stuff coming in Django 1.5. As with all alpha and beta packages, this is not for production use, but if you'd like to try out some of the new goodies coming in 1.5, or if you'd like to pitch in and help us fix bugs before the final 1.5 release (due in December), feel free to grab a copy and give it a spin.</p>

<p>You can get a copy of the 1.5 beta package from our <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/download/">downloads page</a>, and we recommend you read the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.5-beta-1/">release notes</a>. Also, for the security conscious, signed MD5 and SHA1 checksums of the 1.5 alpha package <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.5b1.checksum.txt">are available</a>.</p>

<p>Also, please note that Django 1.5 now requires a minimum of Python 2.6; Python 2.5 is no longer supported. Python 3.x releases, starting with Python 3.2, are experimentally supported in this release. For more information on Python 3 support, and the testing Django 1.5 will still need, see this <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2012/aug/19/experimental-python-3-support/">blog post</a>.</p>
    
<h2>Experimental Python 3 support</h2>
<div class="section" id="s-a-little-bit-of-history">
<h4>A little bit of history</h4>
<p>In May, Vinay Sajip published a fork proving that it was possible to support both Python 2 and 3 with a single codebase, and pass the entire test suite. This fork built upon earlier efforts by Martin von Löwis.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the core team decided to use <a class="reference external" href="http://packages.python.org/six/">six</a> as a compatibility layer, rather than an ad-hoc library. The goal was not only to cover Django's needs, but also to choose a solution that would work for the ecosystem at large. Starting with Django 1.5, <tt class="docutils literal">six</tt> will be bundled as <tt class="docutils literal">django.utils.six</tt>, and thus available for all Django applications that use the same porting strategy as Django itself.</p>
<p>The first actual step towards Python 3 support was to remove the <tt class="docutils literal">u</tt> prefixes of unicode strings and add the <tt class="docutils literal">unicode_literals</tt> future import. This change was committed at the DjangoCon Europe sprints in July.</p>
<p>Then the biggest part of the work happened over the last few weeks, with hundreds of commits updating various parts of Django.</p>
<p>The core team focused on writing Python 3 code with Python 2 compatibility, rather than the opposite, in order to future-proof the code base. In order to avoid confusion, functions and classes whose name included <tt class="docutils literal">string</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">unicode</tt> were renamed to <tt class="docutils literal">bytes</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">text</tt> respectively. As a consequence, the port was significantly more invasive than Vinay Sajip's proof of concept.</p>
<p>On the bright side, since string encoding and decoding operations need to be correct under Python 3, several approximations were corrected during the porting effort. Even though the compatibility code adds some noise, the resulting code is cleaner in many places.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank all the community members and core developers who contributed to this huge project.</p>

<div class="section" id="s-what-s-next">
<h4>What's next?</h4>
<p>Does this mean that Django is ready to use with Python 3? Not yet!</p>
<p>First, Django has received next to none real-life testing under Python 3. Consider the code pre-alpha.</p>
<p>Then, while the core team did its best to eliminate bugs, the test suite doesn't cover all possible uses of Django. That's where the community comes in.</p>
<p>We need your help to test the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/#installing-the-development-version">development version of Django</a>, not only to <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/bugs-and-features/#reporting-bugs">report bugs</a> on Python 3, but also regressions on Python 2. While Django is very conservative with regards to backwards compatibility, mistakes are always possible, and it's likely that the massive refactoring work introduced some regressions.</p>
<p>Finally, Django is much more than a web framework — it's an ecosystem of pluggable applications. At this point, few third-party applications support Python 3. Authors are strongly encouraged to port their pluggable applications as soon as possible. Porting tips are available in the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/python3/">documentation</a>.</p>
